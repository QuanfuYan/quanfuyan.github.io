I earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from China Agricultural University in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Kent State University under the supervision of Mark L. Lewis in 2024. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University, advised by Jiping Zhang.


My research interests are in the Group theory and Character theory of finite groups.
